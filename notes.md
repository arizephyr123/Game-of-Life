Conway's Game of Life is a 2d visualization of how generations of 'organizims' will survive and spread through a given space. Ty given the following simplified rules: 
1. If an organisim is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains alive in the next generation. Else it dies.
2. If an organisim is dead and has exactly 3 neigbors, then it comes back to life in the next generation. Else it stays dead

Cellular Automata(CA) programs are used in research setings to model ecological, epidemiological and chemical simulations as well as CA-based computer processors.
